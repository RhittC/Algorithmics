We are given a set of tasks, and several have prerequisite tasks implicit in the problem description that must have been completed prior. E.g. you cannot bake bread before preheating the oven. So before attempting to find a solution, the very first step should be to represent the tasks and their prerequisites using a model. I shall use a directed graph, with tasks represented with nodes, and edges to a given node from the task's prerequisites."
