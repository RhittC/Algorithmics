    "Say there are limited resources, e.g. rations in war, that must be distributed to people gradually in succession. In the simplest case, the most natural criterion for determining who should be offered resources first is how long they have been waiting. That is, the first person in line should be the first person to get rations (FIFO). This is naturally modelled with the standard Queue ADT."

    "My inspiration behind this problem was the Job Scheduling Greedy Algorithm in the book *Algorithms Illuminated* by Tim Roughgarden I found to be quite intriguing, though the book did not mention priority queue implementation for that algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many greedy algorithms naturally call for priority queues, especially when applied to real-world systems that must be efficient even if users input more data in the midst of execution (simply keeping an array and repeatedly sorting it is inefficient). As greedy algorithms, true to the moniker, first greedily attack the objects that best satisfy certain numerical criteria, it follows that the ADT designed to dynamically rank those objects according to some criteria and serve the best objects on a silver platter is well-suited."

The metric for the optimal ranking of $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ tickets assigned to a certain team is how small the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^n r_i e_i C_i$ would be, where $C_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^+$ is the time elapsed between the completion of ticket $i$ and the assignment of ticket $1$.

    "Evidently, if greater numerical values are considered higher priority, the priority rank given by $p: (\\mathbb{R}^+)^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}, p(r, e, t)$ must be greater when $r$ or $e$ is increased, as there is a greater weightage. When time is increased, $C$ of subsequent tickets are also increased, negatively affecting the optimality metric in the long run. Therefore, as $t$ is increased, $p(r, e, t)$ must be lower.

    "We live in the intellectual utopia of Dijkstrasia, home to IIT (Irodov Institute of Technology), the world's top university for Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science. IIT has a very rigorous entrance examination process that is intended to only accept the brightest of minds. \n",
    "\n",
    "$10$ years ago, in the city of Trantor, several high schools formed a coalition known as the Teal League. These schools then jointly developed the exclusive \"IIT-topper\" course, where enrolled students are prepared extensively for the exam, with an average workload of $14$ hours a day. As a result, the Trantor League schools account for over $60\\%$ of IIT admissions, despite only making up $0.1\\%$ of applicants.\n",

    "For the past few years, parents have been migrating to Trantor en mass in hopes of sending their children to Teal Leagues and clearing a path to IIT. As a result, there is currently a severe underrepresentation of working class citizens in all other parts of Dijkstrasia. The country is unable to support its large retired demographic, and is projected to collapse within the next $50$ years. The only way for Dijkstrasia to evade its imminent downfall is to disincentivise migration to Trantor immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the great lobbyist power of the Teal League, the parliament is unable to pose restrictions on their \"IIT-topper\" course. So, upon great deliberation, Dijkstrasia has decided to attack the IIT examination process instead. We have been assigned the task of designing a new student ranking system that guarantees that admissions are spread across the different regions of Dijkstrasia, and not just awarded on the basis of exam scores alone. Additionally, the implementation should be able to output the rankings of students in each exam centre for each exam round (more on this below)<br><br>\n",

With a regular binary heap implementation of priority queues, this takes $n\\cdot O(\\log{n}) = O(n\\log{n})$ time, where $n$ is the number of students in the batch. With a fibonacci heap, this can be reduced to an amortised complexity of $O(n)$.\n",

    "At its core, the Binary Heap implementation of Priority Queues is a sequence of data nodes that are periodically sorted according to associated priority rankings. However, regular comparison-based sorting algorithms take $O(n\\log{n})$ time. So to insert and sort $n$ nodes repeatedly, it would take the absurd time complexity of $O(n^2\\log{n})$. To reduce this to $O(\\log{n})$ insertion $\\implies O(n\\log{n})$ repeated insertion, Binary Heaps use slightly counter-intuitive techniques.\n",

In terms of data, I am only considering student names, however this can be easily extended to include more details such as student number, school, postal address, etc. as required by the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The defining characteristic of heaps is that the dynamic array is not sorted in descending(ascending) order of priority as one would expect. Instead, each index points to the node at a certain position of a Binary Tree, sorted such that every node's priority rank is larger(smaller) than that of both its children.\n",
